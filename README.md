# 2024 Advent of code solutions

Following along with the challenges on [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/).

Decided (for better or for worse) to try to cycle around a range of languages, testing how well tools like GitHub Copilot can help me solve the problems in a number of different languages.

Plan is to run through the most popular languages (or at least open source ones that I can easily install and run within VSCode) in order,until I fail a day (or until I decide it's a silly idea) and then revert to cycling between R (what I know best), Python and TypeScript (what I'm currently learning in other projects).

[Top languages](https://jeroenheijmans.github.io/advent-of-code-surveys/) in 2023:
